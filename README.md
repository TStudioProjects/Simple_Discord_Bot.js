# Simple_Discord_Bot.js
#
# This is a simple example of creating a Discord bot on JavaScript using Node.js and discord.js v14 and higher
# I think this is suitable for beginners
# In this example, I showed how to use events, as well as slash commands
# I know that my code can be done better, but it will do for beginners
#
# To create the bot, I used the packages: npm install [discord.js, dotenv, ms]. You can also optionally add nodemon
# Thanks for watching!
